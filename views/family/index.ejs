					Our family members used to be total four.
					After father was passed away more than ten years ago, our family members became three.
					My mother was suffering hard situation after he died.
					However, she decided to get over since she had to take care of other family members.
					Thanks to her endless effort, our family was becoming better situation, and found the solution to be happy.
					As a result, we believe that nothing can be more important than harmony between family members.
